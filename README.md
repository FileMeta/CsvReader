## About CodeBits
A [CodeBit](https://www.FileMeta.org/CodeBit.html) is a way to share common code that's lighter weight than NuGet. Each CodeBit consists of a single source code file. A structured comment at the beginning of the file indicates where to find the master copy so that automated tools can retrieve and update CodeBits to the latest version.
